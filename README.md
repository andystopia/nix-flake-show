# Nix Flake Show


Sometimes we need to be able to access 
something like nix flake show, but exclusively, 
in Rust. So this is the crate for that. 

I have a couple of other nix crates, and I'm thinking
I might consolidate them at some point, but I will have
to get them a bit more mature in their apis. 

## Future plans.

 - [ ] `build` subcommand 
 - [ ] `develop` subcommand
